# learning


- couple weeks ago I had to study for a license...

- I <3 to learn with spaced repetition and active recall


- tried a few flashcard tools

- was missing a feature to auto-assess my answers

- and found myself tinkering instead of learning

*spaced repetition*: repeat content in specific intervals

*active recall*: actively retrieve content before looking at the answer

# semanticards
